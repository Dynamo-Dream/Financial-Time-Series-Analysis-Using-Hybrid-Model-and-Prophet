## Repository For Exploring the Impact of Financial News Sentiment on Stock Price Forecasting: A Comparative Deep Learning Approach
- The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
stock price prediction has demonstrated significant advancements, with Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques
proving highly efficient in this domain. Two widely adopted
architectures for stock price prediction are the Long Short Term
Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models.
Recognizing the potential impact of financial news sentiment on
forecasting, this study investigates whether incorporating such
sentiment yields superior results compared to relying solely on
historical stock prices. Accurate predictions in the financial
market are challenging due to its inherent high volatility and
non-linear nature. To contribute insights into the effectiveness
of various deep learning architectures, a comparative analysis
was conducted on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
and the Prophet model. The evaluation focused on three companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The study
employs the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric to rigorously
assess and compare the models’ performance. The results of the
comparative analysis provide valuable implications for precision
in stock price prediction within the context of market volatility
and non-linearity. The study adds to the growing body of research
on the application of AI in financial forecasting, emphasizing
the importance of considering sentiment analysis alongside traditional approaches for enhanced predictive accuracy.
